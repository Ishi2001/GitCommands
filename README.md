# Phishing URL Detection 
A phishing website is a common social engineering method that mimics trustful uniform resource locators (URLs) and webpages. The objective of this project is to train machine learning models and deep neural nets on the dataset created to predict phishing websites. Both phishing and benign URLs of websites are gathered to form a dataset and from them required URL and website content-based features are extracted. The performance level of each model is measures and compared.

## Data Collection
The set of phishing URLs are collected from opensource service called **PhishTank**. This service provide a set of phishing URLs in multiple formats like csv, json etc. that gets updated hourly. To download the data: https://www.phishtank.com/developer_info.php. From this dataset, 5000 random phishing URLs are collected to train the ML models.

The legitimate URLs are obatined from the open datasets of the University of New Brunswick, https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/url-2016.html. This dataset has a collection of benign, spam, phishing, malware & defacement URLs. Out of all these types, the benign url dataset is considered for this project. From this dataset, 5000 random legitimate URLs are collected to train the ML models.

The above mentioned datasets are uploaded to the '[DataFiles]' folder of this repository.

## Feature Extraction
The below mentioned category of features are extracted from the URL data:

1.   Address Bar based Features <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this category 9 features are extracted.
2.   Domain based Features<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this category 4 features are extracted.
3.   HTML & Javascript based Features<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this category 4 features are extracted.

*The details pertaining to these features are mentioned in the [URL Feature Extraction.ipynb.]

So, all together 17 features are extracted from the 10,000 URL dataset and are stored in '[5.urldata.csv]

## Introduction

The Internet has become an indispensable part of our life, However, It also has provided opportunities to anonymously perform malicious activities like Phishing. Phishers try to deceive their victims by social engineering or creating mockup websites to steal information such as account ID, username, password from individuals and organizations. Although many methods have been proposed to detect phishing websites, Phishers have evolved their methods to escape from these detection methods. One of the most successful methods for detecting these malicious activities is Machine Learning. This is because most Phishing attacks have some common characteristics which can be identified by machine learning methods. 


## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning] the repository:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Models & Training

Before stating the ML model training, the data is split into 80-20 i.e., 8000 training samples & 2000 testing samples. From the dataset, it is clear that this is a supervised machine learning task. There are two major types of supervised machine learning problems, called classification and regression.

This data set comes under classification problem, as the input URL is classified as phishing (1) or legitimate (0). The supervised machine learning models (classification) considered to train the dataset in this project are:

* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Multilayer Perceptrons
* XGBoost
* Gradient Boosting Classifier
* Support Vector Machines

All these models are trained on the dataset and evaluation of the model is done with the test dataset. The elaborate details of the models & its training are mentioned in [Phishing Website Detection_Models & Training.ipynb]

## Conclusion
1. The final take away form this project is to explore various machine learning models, perform Exploratory Data Analysis on phishing dataset and understanding their features. 
2. Creating this notebook helped me to learn a lot about the features affecting the models to detect whether URL is safe or not, also I came to know how to tuned model and how they affect the model performance.
3. The final conclusion on the Phishing dataset is that the some feature like "HTTTPS", "AnchorURL", "WebsiteTraffic" have more importance to classify URL is phishing URL or not. 
4. Gradient Boosting Classifier currectly classify URL upto 97.4% respective classes and hence reduces the chance of malicious attachments.

### Next Steps

This project can be further extended to creation of browser extention or developed a GUI which takes the URL and predicts it's nature i.e., legitimate of phishing. *As of now, I am working towards the creation of browser extention for this project. And may even try the GUI option also.* The further developments will be updated at the earliest.
